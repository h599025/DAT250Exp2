# Rapport: DAT250 Experiment 3
<p>I have completed the main part of the assignment, and due to a large workload in different courses I have not done the optional part. I have not tried too hard to catch all the exceptions and make the program robust, but there are some exceptions for catching large errors.</p>
<p>In order to complete the assignment I had to make some changes to the back-end of the program, most notably adding an "if" to handle copying of the list containing voteOptions. This was made necessary as I ran into a problem where in some cases the original list of voteOptions was attempted modified while being iterated over.</p>

<h3>Technical difficulties: </h3>
<p> 1. I had some technical difficulties pretty early with opening the.vue files on my Mac, as the project kept "collapsing" and refreshing everytime I opened a .vue file. I am pretty sure this is due to lack of available RAM, but I not to sure as I only managed to make it not collapse once. However, I have more powerful PC at home which I used to complete the assignment.</p>
<p> 2. Other issues I had was that I struggled quite a bit getting my voteOptions to show in the web browser due to different handling of the objects.</p>
