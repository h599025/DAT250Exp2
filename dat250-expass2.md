# Rapport: DAT250 Experiment 2 
<h3>Note-worthy comments</h3>
I started with the lab prior to the Step-by-Step help on GitHub was released, and I didn't notice it either, so my approach was not exactly like the one on GitHub. Fortunately I have some experience with Spring Boot so it was not as big of a problem. The only problem was that my initial implementation was not entirely compliant with the test you wanted us to run. Therefore, it took some more coding before I was ready to hand it in.

<h3>Technical difficulties: </h3>
<p> 1. I had some problems with getting my Spring boot to run. The problem turned out to be related to my package structure, where I had made packages at the same level as the last other package which contained the Application runner. I unfortunately spent some time before discovering this. </p>
<p> 2. I also had some trouble with the test cases since I have limited experience with it, and it has been a while since I wrote any.</p>

<p>I did complete the assignment, however there are definitely some exceptions and error cases that should be handled, where I have not done well enough to catch them </p>
